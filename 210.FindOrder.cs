// 210. Course Schedule II

// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
// You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if
// you want to take course ai.

// For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
// Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them.
// If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

// Example 1:
// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
// Example 2:
// Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
// Output: [0,2,1,3]
// Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
// So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
// Example 3:
// Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
// Output: [0]
