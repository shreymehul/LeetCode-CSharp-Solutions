// 88. Merge Sorted Array
// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
// Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
// The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

{
    public void Merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            nums1[m + i] = nums2[i];
        }
        Array.Sort(nums1);
    }
